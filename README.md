DR (Diabetic retinopathy) is a common complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision impairment and blindness. 
To save the eyes from suffering irreparable harm, it is essential to identify and treat DR as soon as possible. 
The detection of DR using ML (Machine Learning) has shown encouraging results, and it has the potential to increase the precision and effectiveness of screening and diagnosis. 
In this study, we used a ML and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approach for the detection of presence of DR using retinal images.
We created extracted features using a CNN model, as the convolution and pooling done by it automates the process of feature extraction.
